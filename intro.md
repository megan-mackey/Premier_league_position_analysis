<center><h2>A Dive into Premier League Football</h2></center>

This web app is my first attempt at developing data-driven sports stories with R.

<center><h3>The Model</h3></center>

The aim of this model is to look into the economic consequences of your league position in the English premier league. It is a aim of all teams to either move up to this league or stay in the league all together. The money received from the premier league organization is substantial compared to many leaves in the world. My project will take you on a journey across multiple season in the premier league, to see how this money affects the probability of staying in this league and fighting for the title. The journey will start with the 2005-2006 season and go all the way to the 2014-2015 season. This gives us a great pool of data to draw some conclusions from. 

<br>

<center><h3>Why ?</h3></center>

Money received by clubs will determine the players they can sign, the contracts they can offer players and overall determine the likelihood of survival in the league. This is arguably the most competitive league in the world, so the margins of error are small. Anything to reduce those margins, whether it be employing a world class manager or signing a player, is going to be implemented within reason. As you will see clubs such as Norwich, become part of a cycle where they come up, do not gain the money to continue to stay up and then they become relegated. This example is all too common and are used to try to enable a new system such as equal money for everyone.

<center><h3>How ?</h3></center>

How are we going to do this? I have collated data from the seasons specified above, the first dataset looks at league position and from that we will be able to see how teams who frequently finish in a good position will fair in comparison to teams who frequently finish in the bottom half of the table. The next data set will show the money received by each club in those seasons in accordance with the premier league records. There will also be a tab where we can draw some conclusions from the data.

<center><h3> Possible Limitations </h3></center>

Information selection bias – I have selected the data myself and I have gone out to find the data which links to the question I want to answer. This means there is a possible selection bias


Data presentation- I have elected to not sure all the data in the data set I have selected; this is because it would be a lot to clean but also mainly because it would just cause an information overload for the viewer.


Time Constraints – Time available to study this model is constrained to a deadline, this may mean I might not have time to analyze everything
