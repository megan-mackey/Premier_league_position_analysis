<center><h2>General Considerations</h2></center>

1. In England in 2008, there was an economic recession, this meant money received from teams was not increasing at the same rate it was previously. However, the increases in recent years outside of our model definitely make up for that. 


2. Money is always increasing, so it is important when comparing teams to take it with a pinch of salt. When solely looking at a team an example would be to look at total income and see if they are similar. They should not be due to money increases but comparing between teams is the best way to see if our hypothesis is true.


3. Equal Share payments are always going to be the majority of total income so this category is only there to see how some teams rely so heavily on this income.In the 2014-2015 season, we see a huge increase in this area. Feel free to remove it by pressing the title down in the legend section on the right hand side.
4. For some teams it is hard to adapt to the premier league as the money received in the league below is not the same. So some teams in the model do not have the complete 6 seasons so if we make any conclusions, we should not be as confident with the data comparing to if we had a team with the total 6 seasons in the model.


5. Feel free to use the average trends in all three categories whilst looking at teams to see what an average team might receive in that season

To see the general conclusions, look below the graph but for team specific conclusions look in the key takeaways tab !!!!
