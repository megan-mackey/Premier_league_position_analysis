p1 <- "My project is going to look at the economic consequences of the position you finish in the English
               premier league. I have found a csv file online which shows the position of each premier league from 2005 to 2015.
               So I am planning to filter that down to 2010-2015 so it is not too much data. I would then compare
               this with the market value of premier league teams during this period. There is also the possibility to compare the premier league
               to the other 4 major leagues in Europe and see how their revenues relate. Also,I could see how the economic position of teams affects how much they spend on transfers and we can also look at top
               10 transfers. The first two are the major points I want to go off and the other two could be supplementary."
