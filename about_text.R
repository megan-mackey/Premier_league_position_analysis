       premier league.I have now cleaned my data and created a league position graph which shows the position of each 
        team in a selected season. My next steps are to make this a animated graph and to add the economic
       data which shows the consequences. I will also add informtion to my discussion tab to discuss 
        why I am doing this project. I am thinking of adding the club logo for the league positon graphs"
