<h2>Acknowledgements</h2></center>

Thanks goes out to the Premier League, who compiled and made the financial data available for this project, this data set the base for the data which I ended up creating. My work with the Premier League Seasons data wouldn't have been possible without the files listed above, from which I scraped the seasons data sets. The transfer information was found on the web link above and I would like to thank Brian Mackey for showing me this web database.Finally, I'm thankful to Tyler Simko, Beau Meche and all the TF's in Government 50. They have assisted me in completing this project and without their expertise, this would not have been possible.
