p1 <- "The goal of my project is to investigate the relationship between finish position in the premier league and the economic consequences that
come with that. This model is predictive as I am predicting what will happen, the lower down you finish, the less money you can get and the more
likely a team will be relegated and vice versa when they finish in a higher position in the league. The model will use a point graph on a stacked barplot
to see if we can establish a link."
