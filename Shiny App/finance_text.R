# This contains some conclusions we can deduce from the premier league tab on the app for each team.

# Arsenal text 

arsenal_text <- "Facility fees have increased substantially over the period of time especially during the last two season we looked at. It went from 
being in the low £10,000 bracket to now on the verge of breaking £20,000. Arsenal have never finished outside the top 4, which is important to note
when talking about merit payments. This means they are always receiving money at the higher end of the scale, which adds up if not spent. Their merit
payment have always stayed consistent due to the pattern in their finished position. As we have stated the money is increasing from season to season 
due to increase sales in tv right but using Arsenal as a comparison to other teams is important. Equal share payment takes up the highest propoortion
of income for Arsenal"

aston_villa_text <- " Villa's league position has flucuated during the seasons observed, equal shares payment takes up majority of income for the team.
The lower their position the more they rely on the equal share payment, this is because they recieve a lower amount of merit payment. You can also deduce
that during the last two seasons where their position has gotten consistently worse, the facility fees are decreasing as less people want to watch lower 
teams. The biggest takeaway is how unbalanced their income really becomes when positions in the table start to drop."

birmingham_text <- "As Birmingham's league position decreased, the merit payment decreased substantially, whereas the facility fees decreased but not so much.
This might have caused a mismanagement of money as the money they received in the first season did not allow Birmingham to be as successful in the second season.
The decrease of nearly 10 places is significant."


blackburn_text <- "Blackburn's stay in the premier league in our sample is a short one so many of the assumptions we make might not be as accurate as if we
made them for someone who has spent the entire time in the league. That being said, the model here is almost linear, as the league positions decrease, the
amount of money they recieve in total decreases as well. The drop in merit payment is very drastic over the 3 seasons. Similar to teams who finish in their
position, they come reliant on equal share payments. This just shows that teams who consistently finish in the lower end of the table do not make nearly as
much money than the teams who consistently finish in the upper half."

bolton_text <-"As Bolton's league position decreases, the merit payment really suffers. It goes from £5 million to around £2 million in the space of 2 seasons,
this is a huge loss of income which they are used to receiving. This causes significant harm on the team as they cannot improve it in the way they like. Facility
fees do not decrease so much but such a loss means the equal share payments cannot pick up the slack." 
  
  
  
burnley_text <- "Burnley have had two finished positions right at the bottom of the table, which reflects their pay distribution. The large percentage of
their revenue is coming from the equal share payments. It is also important to see that their total amount of money recieved is only breaking £60 million. 
If you compare this to Villa, who in the same 2014-15 season finished in a similar position in regards to total money recieved but because they recieved
money in higher volumes in previous seasons, this made the reduction not as felt. "

chelsea_text <- "Chelsea's position in the league started on a high by finishing first, but in the next two seasons their position declined in second and sixth. 
This is evident in the money recieved, as both the facility fees and merit payments reduced, causing an overall reduction. It would not be fair to put Chelsea in 
the same group as teams such as Blackburn due to their worldwide fanbase and that their positions are not the same. But, if teams such as Chelsea see a reduction
in money recieved, you can imagine the consequences of this and then imagine how much worse of teams are who finish in 15th and lower."

everton_text <-"Everton were pretty consistent with their league finishes and this shown in the model. They recieved similar amounts of money per catergory until
the last two seasons in the model. Between 2012-2013 and 2013-2014, Everton finished one place higher and you can see the merit payment increases dramatically from
$11.3 million to $19.8 million. This just show how much a one place difference can be on a team and this could allow them to pursue better options for the team in
order to keep improving"

fulham_text <- "As Fulham's league position got better, the amount of merit payment increased. From 2010-2011, the league position was getting progressively worse and
this shows in the distribution of money. They become more reliant on equal share payments as merit payments decrease. Their facility fees stay very consistent, so this 
shows a decrease in overall money received. In 2013-2014, the facility fees go up even though they were finishing in worse places. This goes against the idea that teams
who finish higher up, recieve the most facility fees. It shows that there are multiple teams who finish lower in the table who have a vast fan group. Because of the fan group,
there is more games on tv and this actually helps the team balance out the money lost from the merit payments."

hull_text <- "It is important to note that Hull only survived 3 seasons out of the 6 in the premier league. It is hard for a teams coming up from the championship to adapt to 
the league as the finances in the league below do not come close to those in the premier league. Hull is an example of this and this really harms the merit payments. Facility
fees are also low because majority of teams coming up do not have the fan base like Man Utd so their games are less likely to be shown live. It is so important for teams to finish 
well in their first season and stay up because the money recieved from the premier league is vital to the club's survival"

liverpool_text <- " For the first four seasons in our model, Liverpool consistently finish in the same place and this is easy to infer due to the money recieved in those seasons.
However, in the last two seasons the amount of merit payment and facility fees increases due to the higher league position. From 2012-2013 to 2013-2014, the jump from finishing 7th
to 2nd is incredible. This is in regard to total amount recieved it goes from around £35 million to £70 million. Liverpool have a massive following in England and this shows in the
facility fees, which were consistent throughout and Liverpool knew they did not need to worry about money decreasing from this catergory."

man_city_text <- "As Man City finished higher up the table, merit payments went up. Because they were finishing in higher positions, more of their games were broadcasted live so facility
fees went up. The distribution of money comes more equal between merit payments and facility fees. It is important to take the equal share payments with a grain of salt because they are
the same for all teams and towards the end of my model, increased significantly."

man_utd_text <- "Man utd are one of the most decorated clubs in English football and this shows when we look at the money recieved. Their position in the first 4 seasons in our model were
very consistent and so they recieved similar amounts of money each year. But as their position decreased, the distribution of money becomes less equal and equare share payments takes up more
of the money recieved"

portsmouth_text <- "Portsmouth only stayed one season in the premier league in our model and this did not help their finances. They received just over £20 million which is nothing compared to
the team who finished first recieved around £45 million. The premier league is one of the most competitive leagues in the world so the margin for success are small and must be maximised. An 
example is financially, it is hard for teams like portsmouth to compete with teams who are used to receiving the premier league pay cheque every season."

stoke_text <-"In the first 4 seasons, as league positions remain constant the income stays consistent with this however as their presence in the league becomes more known, the last two seasons 
see more facility fees as more games are broadcasted. More games are also broadcasted as they begin to move up the table and mean they have an increased income in general." 
  

sunderland_text <- "The league position for sunderland flucuates and this can be seen by the up and down motion of the facility fees and merit payment. Even though, there is flucuation, equal
share payments per year made up for the changes and made the total amount of money consistent. This is great for teams such as Sunderland as they roughly can guess the amount they will receive
in the end."

tottenham_text <- "Tottenham have been fairly consistent in their league positions. This shows in the model as the model recieved in facility fees and merit payments. In the last two seasons in
our model, there is a increase in equal share payments which although increases total amount of money received it does not affect facility fees and merit payments too much. Because they are
finishing in similar positions each year, it is easy to predict and plan for the years ahead."

west_ham_text <- "West Ham missed out on one of the seasons in the model, 2011-2012. However, without knowing the league positions it would be possible to infer this relegation due to the low amounts
of merit payment and facility fees received. It would be hard for West Ham to compete without breaking the financial fair play rules where it avoids teams being put into debt. But on the other hand,
once they have comeback their facility fees and merit payments increased from the last stay in the league because they finished in a better position and then could invest in the team to get better and
in the last two seasons, they finished higher each time"

wigan_text <- "Wigan finished in the bottom 5 positions in the league during the model. Although their total money received was fairly consistent between £20 -25 million, it was low in comparison to a team
finishing mid table in each of these seasons. Although, it was better than being in the league below, the cumulative money over time was not great and this meant they could not invest in the team to solve the
problem, they had to look at different players within their budget. This ultimately led to their relegation"

wolves_text <- "They were only present in the league for two seasons but the model shows a linear pattern. As their league position decreased, the merit payments decreased and facility fees decreased. 
It also did not help that equal share payments decreased too so there were no ways to limit the decrease in money for the future and help them rebound quickly back into the league. Total amount of money
is also very low because of this and would make it hard to spend as freely as other clubs."

newcastle_text <- "Newcastle's positions were very different from year to year so it would be hard to predict an amount for the future. As they finished in a worse league position, merit payments went down
considerably whereas facility fees stayed pretty similar for the first 3 seasons. In the last two seasons when league position improved and then went down again, total amount of money went up mainly due to
equal share payments and being in the league but also because of facility fees. Newcastle were in the league for a while, fans wanted to watch them play."

west_brom_text <- "As league positions got better, merit payments went up and so did facility fees but not by as much. However in 2013-2104, when league positions got worse again, facility fees increased as more
of their games were being broadcasted. This popularity grew from being in higher positions in the table, this did not affect their total.They actually received more money when they finished 17 than they did 8th.
This money meant they could improve the team and the following season finish 13th."

blackpool_text <- "Similar to a few teams in the model only were in the league for one season so it is hard to draw many conclusions . However, if we compare to the winners of that season Man City. They received in total
around £45 million whereas Blackpool who finished 19th received just over £20 million. You can imagine how a little more money by even finishing 18th could have helped their bounce back to the premier league. Unfortuantely,
today we are still waiting for their return."

qpr_text <- "They narrowly avoided relegation in the first season, which would help the team financially however the following season they were relegated. This just shows that if you don't spend the money in the right way or at all, 
it will affect the team. Of course , we need to take into account lack of performance but they spent one season in the championship before coming back up to the premier league. This shows the financial superiorty teams have when
they receive that pay cheque even if they are relegated. However, because the money received in the championship is substantially lower, staying in the league in the 1st season is especially difficult."

norwich_text <- "The hypothesis we drew in the begining that teams who finished lower in the league were financial worse off but as we look more at teams, Norwich is an example which shows that this is not the case.
As they finished lower in the league, if we exclude equal share payments, means that over the 3 seasons in the league, they are receiving similar amounts of money. This makes us think that the money received per season 
per catergory increases but we must remember that this is not comparing to other teams. Which means the gap is not as close as we see."

swansea_text <- "Swansea survived the first season in the league, the longer the team stays in the league, the more people want to watch them play and this is shown with increased facility fees. Merit payments also went up. The 
cumlulative money received during their stay in the league has allowed them to get better year on year. "
  
reading_text <- "Reading could not survive the one season curse of the league and  only received around £20 million. From previous teams, we can see this is nothing compared to upper and mid table teams however it will help them 
when they are in the championship."

southampton_text <- "As Southampton finish in higher and higher positions in the league, the merit payments increase and facility fees do too. The facility fees increase as there is more popularity. So there is a linear relationship formed.
Due to equal share payments increasing each year too, this meant an even higher increase each time"

cardiff_text <- "Unfortunately, Cardiff only spent 1 season in the league and only 1/3 of their total income during this season was from merit payments and facility fees. So Cardiff relied heavily on the equal share payments."

crystal_palace_text <-"AS Crystal Palace finished higher in the league, the merit payments increased. Although, it was not a massive increase, it still amounted to nearly £2 million which is a lot of money. Facility fees also increase but
by not even 1 million. The equal share payments become a big chunk of the income however, the percentage increases. "

leicester_text <- "In the final season in our model, leicester had just been promoted. Even so, they recieved over £60 million. If we compare this to Blackpool, who were only in the 2010-11 season. Blackpool receieved just over £20 million
for a 19 th place finish. Leicester finished 14th so it just shows how much more is received"
